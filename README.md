# React Hook Form

A simple React form built using React Hook Form that demonstrates form validation, submission handling, and dynamic user feedback. The form includes real-time validation for required fields, minimum/maximum character length checks, and displays error messages accordingly. After a successful submission, the form resets automatically, and a success message appears briefly for 3 seconds before disappearing.

## This project is great for learning or demonstrating:

- Form validation with React Hook Form

- Conditional rendering of error and success messages

- Managing form submission states (isSubmitting, isSubmitSuccessful)
